            Hi, my name is Jacob Helsel. I was born in California, moved to Minnesota for 10 years, and have lived in Georgia now for just over a decade. 
            I&#39;m a recent graduate interested in programming, sports, traveling, and music.
          </p> 
          <p>
            My favorite sports to play are basketball, soccer, and tennis. I also like to watch the NBA and NFL (Go ATL Hawks, MN Vikings, and GA Dawgs!) 
          </p>
          <p>
            Summer of 2022 I took my first trip international to Seoul, South Korea! I had a lot of fun exploring the city on rental bikes and experiencing a different culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;m not very picky listening to songs, so I listen to a variety of genres.
            When I practice piano, I usually learn chords for songs I like.
          </p>

          <p>
            I graduated Spring 2023 from the University of Georgia&#39;s 
            Terry College of Business with a major in MIS.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at UGA, I learned effective business practices and took on different software projects with multiple teams. 
            I also enjoyed biking and exploring every part of the campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current goal is to grow more as a person by learning something new every day. 
            This could be through books, classes, or interactions with others. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I have been focused on becoming proficient in python by taking an online python bootcamp. 
            I also want to expand my knowledge of web development, which has led me to creating this website! 
            This is my first version of the site, so I hope to improve its quality as I learn more about webdev.
